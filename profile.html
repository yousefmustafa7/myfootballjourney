                <h2 class="mt-5">ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in Amman, Jordan, the country's capital city, into a family that loved football as much as anyone in Jordan. I have always loved this sport and started playing in a football academy when I was 8 years old.<br><br>

                    Ever since I was very young, I had dreamed of having a career in football. I grew up idolizing the Brazilian players, watching how they play the game in a way that makes whoever is watching them fall in love with the game. I was truly blessed to have a supportive family that helped me pursue my goals.<br><br>
                    As I was growing up, I was playing for Al Ahli youth team, which plays in the first division of the Jordanian league. After just a few matches, I was lucky enough to be called up to the national team, which I definitely consider a great achievement for me.<br><br>
                    However, as part of my culture, education is highly important. My parents wanted me to focus on studying, not that they didnâ€™t believe in me, but they told me it would be hard to live my dream in Jordan. I stood up to them though a bit, I wanted to fight back and see where football could take me. I was extremely happy when I landed this opportunity to come to Hungary as I could have both my education as well as exploring where my football path leads me.
